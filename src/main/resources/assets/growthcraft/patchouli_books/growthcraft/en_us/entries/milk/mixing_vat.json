Fluids are added to the mixing vat by right-clicking on the block with a filled bucket of fluid. There are two fluid handlers that are accessible by either the top face of the block or the sides."

In order for the mixing vat to start mixing the ingredients, it must be right-click activated by the activation tool listed in the recipe. This is generally a wooden sword or a stick. If the recipe results in an item, there will be a secondary activation tool that will be consumed upon drawing the item (cheese curds require a cheesecloth)."
